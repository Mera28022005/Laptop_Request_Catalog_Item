Laptop Request Catalog Item - Project Designing phase

This repository contains the documentation for the Laptop Request Catalog Item project in ServiceNow, covering the project solution, design, and proposed solution.

 Project Solution
1. Understand the needs of users requesting laptops and the issues they face with the current manual process.  
2. Generate ideas to automate laptop requests, track approvals, and improve fulfillment efficiency.  
3. Users face delays and lack visibility in laptop request processing; the objective is to streamline requests through a ServiceNow catalog item.  

Project Design
1. Understand the system requirements, user interactions, and backend processes needed for the laptop request catalog item.  
2.  Design the UI layout, approval workflows, business rules, notifications, and database structure. Decide on the architecture including client-server interactions, workflow engine, and integration points.
3. The design should ensure smooth request submission, automated approvals, data integrity, and scalability of the ServiceNow catalog item.  

Proposed Solution
1.  Consider how the implemented design will solve user pain points and support IT operations efficiently.  
2.  Plan the implementation steps: create catalog item, configure workflows, apply business rules, add notifications, and test the system.  
3.  Deliver a fully functional, automated ServiceNow catalog item that streamlines laptop requests, improves request tracking, and enhances user satisfaction.
