 Performance Testing

1. Understand the system’s behavior under normal and peak load conditions to ensure smooth request processing, timely approvals, and fast notification delivery.  
2. Identify key performance metrics and test scenarios:  
   - Average response time for submitting a laptop request  
   - Time taken for approvals to process through workflow  
   - Notification delivery time to users and approvers  
   - System behavior under multiple simultaneous users (load testing)  
   - Database performance and retrieval speed for request records  
3. Ensure the system can handle multiple requests efficiently, maintain response times under high load, deliver notifications promptly, and operate reliably without errors or delays.
